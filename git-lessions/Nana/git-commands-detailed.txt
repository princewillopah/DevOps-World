Branch: 
- You can create branches on the portal/dashboard(remotely) and via CLI(Locally). If it is created on portal, you have to run git pull, for it to be reflected on the local repo.
- git pull is enough to get all the changes done and update the local repos
- git pull [remote] [branch]: Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them with the local repository
- git branch: Shows a list of all branches in the repository
- git checkout [branch]: Switches to the specified branch.
- git checkout -b [branch]: Creates a new branch and switches to the specified branch.
- git merge [branch]: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.
          --no-ff: Forces a merge commit even if the merge is a fast-forward.
- git branch -d [branch name]: Deletes a branch that has already been merged into the current branch.
- git branch -m [new branch name]: Renames the current branch to a new name.
